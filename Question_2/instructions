Binary Encoding
===============

A form of binary encoding is required where
transitions between consecutive numbers differ by
only one bit. This is a useful encoding for reducing
hardware data hazards with values that change rapidly
and/or connect to slower hardware as inputs

Create functions to encode a number to, and decode a
number from, your binary encoding. Your encoding
should support the full range of values representable
by normal binary encoding for the number of bits you
use. (e.g. if you use 8-bit in your encoded number
then you should be able to represent the values from
0 to 255)

Display the normal binary representations, your
binary representations, and the decoded values of
your binary representation for all 5-bit binary
numbers (0-31 inclusive, leading 0's not necessary).
