You're developing a system that uses a two line LCD.

Your task is to write a function that takes two arguments,
a string and an integer width.

The function returns two values the first indicates the index
where the string should be wrapped so words are not split
over the first and second line unless they are longer than a
line. The second value indicates the (index + 1) of the
last char to be displayed.

e.g:
If you have a 8 character wide display and you pass in the
following strings the expected indexes are indicated:

"Hello World"
       ^    ^

"Hello World a answer"
       ^       ^

"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"
         ^       ^
