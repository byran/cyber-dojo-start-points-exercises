ADC Smoothing
=============

Youâ€™re developing a mixing desk and need to read the
position of the faders. Each fader is attached to your
micro controller via an ADC pin. When reading the ADC
you notice there are 4-bits of noise  on the readings.

The fader position is transmitted over MIDI every time
it changes.

Develop a smoothing algorithm that removes the noise
while still providing a fast response time to reduce
the number of packets that need to be sent over the
MIDI bus.

The smoothed reading must be within 1% of the actual
reading within 10ms.
