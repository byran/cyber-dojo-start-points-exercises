Reading a temperature using a microcontroller is often
accomplished using an ADC. The ADC will produce integer
readings which represent the voltage at the input pin
of the microcontroller. These readings require
conversion to a value representing a temperature to be
used in the rest of the system.

Create a linear interpolator to convert an unsigned
10-bit ADC reading to a temperature represented as
a signed integer with a minimum width of 16-bits.
