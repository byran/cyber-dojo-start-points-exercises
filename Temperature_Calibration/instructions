A product you're developing measures temperature using a thermocouple
attached to an ADC. The thermocouple requires calibrating. The
calibration procedure has already been written and produces a
calibration table to allow conversion of ADC reading to temperatures.

Your task is to convert an ADC reading to a temperature using the
calibration table.

Example:

| Temperature | ADC |
| 0           | 10  |
| 50          | 375 |
| 100         | 948 |

With the calibration table above an ADC reading of 302 will
give a temperature of 40 if the data is linearly interpolated.

Additional exercises:
* Only use integer maths.
